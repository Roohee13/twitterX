# X clone backend

A minimal X (Twitter) clone REST API built with Spring Boot 4, PostgreSQL, and Cloudflare R2 for images.

Features: JWT auth (access + rotating refresh tokens), profiles, posts with up to 4 images, replies, likes, follows, blocking, a home timeline, and user search.

## Running locally

Requirements: Java 17+ and a local PostgreSQL.

```bash
createdb -U postgres xclone          # once
createdb -U postgres xclone_test     # once, used by the tests
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The schema is managed by Flyway (`src/main/resources/db/migration`) and applied on startup; Hibernate only validates it. **Any entity change needs a new `V<n>__*.sql` migration.** Configuration comes from environment variables; see `.env.example`. The defaults connect to `localhost:5432/xclone` as `postgres`/`postgres`. **`JWT_SECRET` (at least 32 bytes) is required**, so export one before running, e.g. `export JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)`.

### Redis

Redis backs shared state (rate limits, caches, counters) so the API can run as several instances. Locally run
`docker compose up -d redis`; in production set `REDIS_URL` (Upstash: the `rediss://` TLS URL). The app connects lazily.

### Neon

Use Neon's pooled connection string (host contains `-pooler`) as `DB_URL` and its direct string as `MIGRATION_DB_URL`, both with `?sslmode=require`; see `.env.example`. A database that already has the tables from an older `ddl-auto` setup is adopted as V1 automatically.

R2 is optional for local development. Without `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`/`R2_ACCESS_KEY`/`R2_SECRET_KEY`, everything works except media endpoints, which return `503`.

Run the tests with `./mvnw test`. They need the `xclone_test` database, and R2 is mocked.

## Cloudflare R2 setup

1. Create a bucket and an R2 API token with Object Read & Write access.
2. Enable public access (the r2.dev subdomain or a custom domain) and set `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to it.
3. Add a CORS policy on the bucket so browsers can upload directly:

```json
[{ "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:5173"], "AllowedMethods": ["PUT"], "AllowedHeaders": ["content-type", "content-length"], "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600 }]
```

### Image upload flow

1. `POST /api/media/upload-url` `{ "contentType": "image/png", "contentLength": 12345 }` returns `{ key, uploadUrl, headers, publicUrl, expiresAt }`.
2. `PUT` the file bytes to `uploadUrl` with the returned `headers` (Content-Type must match).
3. Use `key` in `mediaKeys` when creating a post, or as `avatarKey`/`bannerKey` in `PATCH /api/users/me`.

Allowed types are jpeg, png, webp and gif, up to 5 MB by default. The server only accepts keys under the caller's own `users/{id}/` prefix that actually exist in the bucket.

## API

All endpoints are under `/api`. Send `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` for authenticated calls. Errors use RFC 9457 problem JSON.

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | – | `{username, email, password, displayName}` |
| POST | `/auth/login` | – | `{usernameOrEmail, password}` |
| POST | `/auth/refresh` | – | `{refreshToken}`; rotates the token, and reusing an old one revokes all sessions |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | – | `{refreshToken}` |
| POST | `/auth/verify-email` | – | `{token}` from the emailed link; 400 if invalid, expired or already used (204 on success) |
| POST | `/users/me/verify-email` | ✓ | resend the verification email; 409 if already verified |
| POST | `/auth/forgot-password` | – | `{email}`; always 204 so it can't be used to find accounts; emails a reset link (valid 1h) to active accounts |
| POST | `/auth/reset-password` | – | `{token, newPassword}`; sets the password and signs out every session; 400 if invalid, expired or already used |
| GET / PATCH | `/users/me` | ✓ | PATCH `{displayName?, bio?, avatarKey?, bannerKey?}`; `""` clears |
| GET | `/users/search?q=` | – | prefix match on username / display name |
| GET | `/users/me/blocks` | ✓ | users you blocked, paged |
| GET | `/users/{username}` | optional | profile + counts + `followedByMe` + `blockedByMe` |
| POST / DELETE | `/users/{username}/follow` | ✓ | idempotent |
| POST / DELETE | `/users/{username}/block` | ✓ | idempotent; removes follows both ways. Blocked pairs can't follow, like or reply to each other or see each other's posts (403), and are hidden from each other's reply and follower lists |
| GET | `/users/{username}/followers`, `/following` | – | paged |
| GET | `/users/{username}/posts`, `/replies`, `/likes` | optional | paged |
| POST | `/posts` | ✓ | `{content?, mediaKeys?, replyToId?, quotedPostId?, replyPolicy?}`. `replyPolicy` (`EVERYONE` default, `FOLLOWING` = accounts the author follows, `MENTIONED` = accounts @mentioned in the post) is set on top-level posts only (400 on replies and quotes). Replying against it is 403; the author can always reply |
| POST | `/posts/thread` | ✓ | `{posts: [{content?, mediaKeys?}, ...], replyPolicy?}`, 2–25 posts created atomically; each replies to the previous |
| PATCH | `/posts/{id}/reply-policy` | ✓ | `{replyPolicy}`; author-only, top-level posts only; applies to future replies |
| GET | `/posts/{id}/thread` | optional | the conversation's top-level post plus the author's own chained posts, oldest first (others' replies excluded) |
| GET / DELETE | `/posts/{id}` | optional / ✓ | delete is author-only (soft delete) |
| GET | `/posts/{id}/replies` | optional | paged, oldest first. Every post response includes `conversationId`, `replyPolicy` and `canReply` (for the viewer) |
| POST / DELETE | `/posts/{id}/like` | ✓ | idempotent |
| GET | `/posts/{id}/likes` | – | users who liked, paged |
| GET | `/notifications` | ✓ | follow / like / reply / mention notifications, newest first, paged; hides blocked or inactive actors |
| GET | `/notifications/unread-count` | ✓ | |
| POST | `/notifications/read`, `/notifications/{id}/read` | ✓ | mark all / one as read |
| DELETE | `/notifications/{id}` | ✓ | |
| GET | `/timeline` | ✓ | your posts + people you follow, newest first |
| POST | `/media/upload-url` | ✓ | see above |

**Pagination.** Paged endpoints accept `?cursor=&limit=` (default 20, max 50) and return `{ items, nextCursor }`. Pass `nextCursor` back to get the next page; `null` means there are no more pages.

## Email

Registering and changing your email send a verification link (`emailVerified` in the user response; accounts that
existed before this feature count as verified). Nothing is blocked for unverified users yet. Links point to
`FRONTEND_URL/verify-email?token=…` and `FRONTEND_URL/reset-password?token=…`. Set `SPRING_MAIL_HOST` (plus
`_PORT`, `_USERNAME`, `_PASSWORD`) to send real email; without it the app logs the email, link included, instead.
